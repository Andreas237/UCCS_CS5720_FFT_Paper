# UCCS_CS5720_FFT_Paper #

### Summary ###
Final paper for CS5720 Algorithms class.  Implement an FFT and analyze it.  Write about it.



### Given Specs ###
Submit a 5-15 page report detailing what you did on your project. Most projects are expected to include a from-scratch implementation and empirical (and theoretical, if possible) analysis of some algorithm(s); if you are not planning on doing this make sure to contact me to clear your project. The exact content will differ somewhat from project to project, but at a minimum your report must include

* Background on your topic.
* Details of your implementation:
  * What design choices (if any) did you make?
  * What language/environment did you use?
  * How did you validate the correctness of your implementation?
  * How did you test your implementation for efficiency/effectiveness?
* Analysis of your implementation:
  * Empirical analysis results, such as plots and/or tables of runtimes, explanations of anomalous behavior, considerations of how various input characteristics affect run times, etc.
  * Did you perform a theoretical analysis of your algorithm's efficiency? If so, include it.
* Any other information that you feel would help demonstrate what you learned in completing the project.

If you give me a draft by December 1st, I will return it within a week with comments on its appropriateness for the final project report.
